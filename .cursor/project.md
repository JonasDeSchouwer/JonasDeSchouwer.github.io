# Personal Website

Here, we build the personal website of Jonas De Schouwer, which he will use to showcase his research, personal projects, and thoughts on research. Jonas will soon start his PhD at Stanford, working on graph and geometric deep learning.

The final website will contain the following subpages:
1. About
2. News
3. Research & Publications
4. Software Projects
5. Blog
6. Contact Me

The current version is based on a template by Christian Haller.
