## Bio

Jonas De Schouwer is a PhD student at Stanford University working on graph and geometric deep learning.
His research focuses on developing novel neural network architectures for graph-structured data and geometric problems.
These models are useful for analyzing complex relationships in data, automating pattern recognition, and discovering meaningful correlations in structured information.
Furthermore, Jonas works on advancing the theoretical foundations of geometric deep learning to support applications in various domains where graph-structured data is prevalent.

During his academic journey, Jonas has developed expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and computer science fundamentals.
He is passionate about bridging theoretical advances with practical applications in the field of artificial intelligence.

Outside his technical roles, Jonas enjoys exploring new technologies, reading research papers, and contributing to the broader machine learning community.
He believes in the importance of open science and sharing knowledge to advance the field collectively.
