## Statement of Research (Graph and Geometric Deep Learning)

### Overview of the field

Graph and geometric deep learning represents a cutting-edge intersection of machine learning, graph theory, and geometric methods. This field addresses the challenge of learning from data that has inherent structure - whether it's social networks, molecular structures, knowledge graphs, or any system where relationships between entities are as important as the entities themselves. Traditional deep learning approaches, while powerful for grid-structured data like images or sequences, often struggle with the irregular, non-Euclidean nature of graph-structured data.

The fundamental challenge lies in developing neural network architectures that can effectively process and learn from graph-structured data while preserving the geometric and topological properties that make this data meaningful. This requires novel approaches to convolution, pooling, and attention mechanisms that respect the underlying graph structure and geometric constraints.

### Research Focus

My research focuses on developing novel neural network architectures for graph-structured data and geometric problems. Specifically, I work on:

1. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Developing architectures that can effectively learn representations of nodes, edges, and entire graphs while preserving structural information.

2. **Geometric Deep Learning**: Exploring how to apply deep learning to non-Euclidean domains like manifolds, graphs, and other geometric structures.

3. **Theoretical Foundations**: Understanding the theoretical properties of graph neural networks, including their expressive power, stability, and generalization capabilities.

4. **Applications**: Applying these methods to real-world problems in domains such as:
   - Molecular property prediction and drug discovery
   - Social network analysis
   - Knowledge graph reasoning
   - Computer vision with geometric constraints
   - Natural language processing with structured knowledge

### Current Research Projects

**Project 1: Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks**

Graph Neural Networks have shown remarkable success in various applications, but their theoretical understanding is still incomplete. This project aims to characterize the expressive power of different GNN architectures and understand what types of graph properties they can and cannot learn.

**Project 2: Geometric Attention Mechanisms**

Attention mechanisms have revolutionized natural language processing and computer vision. This project explores how to extend attention to graph-structured data and geometric domains.

**Project 3: Scalable Graph Neural Networks**

As graph sizes grow, the computational complexity of GNNs becomes a significant bottleneck. This project focuses on developing scalable GNN architectures that can handle large-scale graphs efficiently.

### Future Research Directions

**Geometric Deep Learning for 3D Vision**

Extending deep learning to 3D geometric data presents unique challenges due to the non-Euclidean nature of 3D shapes and the need for rotation and translation invariance.

**Graph Neural Networks for Scientific Discovery**

Graphs naturally model many scientific problems, from molecular interactions to social networks. Future research will focus on drug discovery and molecular property prediction.

**Theoretical Advances in Geometric Deep Learning**

Building a solid theoretical foundation for geometric deep learning is crucial for the field's advancement.

## Teaching and Mentoring Philosophy

### Summary

>It is imperative that tomorrow's machine learning researchers are equipped not only with **strong mathematical foundations**, but also the **creativity** to conceive of new architectures, and the **practical skills** to implement and evaluate those ideas.

### Cutting-Edge Technology

Machine learning and deep learning have evolved rapidly over the past decade, with new architectures and techniques emerging constantly. The field of graph and geometric deep learning is particularly dynamic, requiring researchers to stay current with both theoretical advances and practical implementations.

### Commitment to Open Science

I believe strongly in the importance of open science and reproducible research. This includes sharing code and data when possible, publishing preprints, and contributing to open-source projects.

### Collaborative Learning Environment

I strive to create an inclusive and collaborative learning environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and sharing ideas, and where different perspectives and backgrounds are valued.
