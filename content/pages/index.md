I am a computer scientist with a deep passion for hard problems. I will soon be starting a PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University, focusing on research in graph and geometric machine learning. Before this, I did my MSc in Computer Science at the University of Oxford and my BSc in Engineering Science at KU Leuven. I competed in (inter)national olympiads in mathematics, informatics, and physics, and am still active in the training programme for the Belgian delegation of the IMO.
